[![Discord Bots](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=848242994648973312&permissions=1133584&scope=bot)](https://dsc.lol/nintendobot)

Check out the bot [on dsc.gg](https://dsc.lol/nintendobot) or even host it yourself!

### To Host It Yourself

- Navigate to the folder you want to download the bot to
- Run `git clone https://github.com/Nha1337/ghostPingRevenge` in the command prompt
- In the folder that contains **bot.js**, create a file called **config.env**
- In the **config.env** file, add `TOKEN=[replace this with a Discord bot token]`.
- Invite the bot to your server. You can generate an invite for your bot [here](https://discordapi.com/permissions.html)
- Run `npm start` into the command prompt, and you should see the bot come online!

> **Note**: Your computer must be switched on for the bot to stay online! If this is all too complex for you, you can always add [the bot which we host ourselves](https://dsc.lol/nintendobot).
